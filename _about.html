<h1>About </h1>
<p>
I'm Daddy Warcrimes, a cartoon arch-villain and nemesis of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
When I'm not engaged in my various criminal enterprises, I like to play a little guitar, write a little code, and stream traditional hand tool woodwork on <a href="https://twitch.tv/daddy_warcrimes">Twitch</a>
</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>
I've been doing woodwork as a hobby since about 2016. Almost everything I know I learned online.
</p>
<p>
I've been writing scripts since the 90's. Back then we had DOS machines, and if you couldn't use the CLI, then the machine didn't work. I'm currently enrolled in a computer science undergrad program in order to learn real programming.
</p>
<p>
I've been playing guitar poorly since the late 90s. I pretty much only perform at open mic, but I do really enjoy playing.
